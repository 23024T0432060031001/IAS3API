This file, `IA_S3.html`, is the original file I was writing while I was at [Internet Archive](http://archive.org). It is the source for the majority of the content in this doc (at least at the time of launch).

The file is HTML (duh). If you view the source you'll see a lot of notes in comments.

It's committed here for reference & posterity.

It is **NOT** to be edited/altered. Pull requests for it will be declined.
