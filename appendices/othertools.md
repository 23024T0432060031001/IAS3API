## Other Internet Archive Tools

There are other tools available for uploading, updating, and downloading items at [Internet Archive](http://archive.org).

### ia-wrapper

[ia-wrapper](https://github.com/jjjake/ia-wrapper) is a Python tool written by [Jake Johnson](https://github.com/jjjake) at Internet Archive. Quoth Jake:

> This package installs a CLI tool named `ia` for using archive.org from the command-line. It also installs the `internetarchive` python module for programatic access to archive.org.

Using either the command line tool (`ia`) or the Python library (`internetarchive`), you can: 

* create items
* upload files
* download files from items
* retrieve and maintain metadata
* perform data mining on the Internet Archive metadata database
* view the status of item processing tasks in the catalog.

The documentation for installation and use of this tool are available at [its Github page](https://github.com/jjjake/ia-wrapper).

### Metadata API

The Internet Archive Metadata API is intended for fast, flexible, and reliable reading and writing the metadata for Internet Archive items.

The documentation for the Metadata API is available in [this blog post](http://blog.archive.org/2013/07/04/metadata-api/).

### BitTorrent Downloads

Each item on Internet Archive automatically receives a [torrent file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file) which can be usedâ€“in conjunction with a [BitTorrent client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BitTorrent_clients) to download all of the files in an item.

The link to the torrent file is located in the left side bar of the item's details page.
